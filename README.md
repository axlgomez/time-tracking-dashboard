# Time tracking dashboard

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding project.

## The project

I have build out this **dashboard**.

In this project I have practiced working with JSON data. The file is located in the "js" folder. I pulled the data from there instead of using HTML content.

You should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
    - addEventListener()
    - querySelector()
    - arrow functions
    - innerHTML
    - classList
    - Template literals
